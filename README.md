## Purpose

Our Client wanted to establish a full stack web application, the web app will serve 2 main purposes. First purpose is to allow users to log and share their experiences from their travels. Second purpose is allow client to login and manage the content of the posts. 

The client wanted to establish this platform to create a niche and target a consumer base that has a strong focus on travel experiences and tips. The client realised that although there is social media applications and booking web applications that allow users to post content about where they have travelled, there was no application available that essentially combined the features of both with a focus on experiences and tips for other users. The client wanted to establish this app to allow users to be able to effectively search for unique experiences posted by others with a sole focus on travel instead of either just scrolling through all the other content of social media apps or search for destinations with no prior knowledge provided that allows them to make the most of their trip. 

*********

### Target Audience

**All Users:**
The application will be protected and will require all users to login via authentication which will assign them the appropiate permissions such as user and admin. Users will be prompted to create an acount through the web application while admin users will need their accounts established by the assign data manager. 
- Login
- Logout

**Users**
When authenticated, users are allowed to access their personalised Dashboard that will feautrem recommended blogs and experiences based on their preferences and interests. 
- Create an Account 
- Display their content
- Edit their content
- Delete their content
- View other users' content
- Like/Unlike users' content
- Comment on users' content
- Follow/Unfollow users

**Admin** 
Once the Admin has been provided with credentials that grant them permissions and access to manage content as required for their role 
- Create/Delete/Edit/View Users
- Create/Delete/Edit/View Users' Content
- Manage User permissions
- Moderate content

****************
### Planning (Sprints)

At the beginning of the project we had a briefing to delegate tasks and design a rough idea of how the app works. We then used Trello as a workload planner to organise and prioritise taks. We were responsible for ensuring that we completed appointed tasks in a timely manner and ensured we added notes to encourage communication during our regular meetings. We will hold regular status meetings through Discord to communicate any issues and challenges we encounter during this project. 

With planning initially we plan to have the sprint organised in weekly sprints 

**Week 1**
- Implementation and establishment of Front-end and Back-end
- Establish login functionality for Users and Admin
- Integrate Amazon S3 functionality

**Week 2**
- Program CRUD functionality for both Users and Admin
- Integrate Google API functionality
- Integrate Personalised Dashboard for users 

**Week 3**
- Testing of code
- Front end cleaning up and testing for responsiveness
- Final touches before launch

Currently we have the Trello Screenshots for planning stage of MERN stack web application (see below). We created a simple Kanban board to plan out our tasks, which were split into four section. Planning phase, In progress phase, review phase and completed task phase. The planning phase was where we assigned tasks to each other and set priorities and due dates to each task. Once we start to work on those tasks the task was moved to the 'in progress' section. After completing the task we would review the task (move task to review) and then if it there were no changes to be made we would move that task to 'completed tasks' section. This methodology allowed us to keep track of our progress on the project.

### Workflow

We decided to work as a team within a Github Organisation and utlise forking to maintain integrity of version control. This will allow us to monitor changes made by team members effectively. We will be checking each of the pull requests to the main branch. We believe this will be the best approach to working in an agile project environment with team members working across on different aspects of the web application. Most tasks will be completed alone by each team member so this branching and pull requests will allow other team member to keep track of other's work.

## Wireframes  

* Link to Travelling Diary wireframe in Figma: [Travelling Diary wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/2SzEZyh3gIW4xpwTy1KAYM/Traveling-Diary?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=jx4ebmZ2z4hPXJbJ-0).  

In the link above it clearly illustrates the relationships between each page of the application. Also, the functionality of each page and it's features are explained in detail.  

A mobile first approach was implemented when designing the wireframes for this application. We wanted a light-coloured themed interface for the application that was easy to use. Based on this criteria, we chose to use the colours white, black and two different shades of orange. 

### Mobile Login Page 

* It can be seen in the image below that the login page and create account page are essentially the same except for some of the wording. Initially, these two pages did not look like this, as we didn't have a logo designed and there was an image in the background. Upon further development, the background image was removed and a logo was created. The logo was placed near the top of the page as this introduces our brand to the user. This is then followed by the login heading and the login details, which are position in the center of the page. Two orange bars were added to the top and bottom of the page to give it the light orange coloured theme design.  

![screenshot of mobile login and create account page wireframe](./docs/wireframe-images/mobile-login-create.png)  


### Mobile Blogs List Page  

* With the blogs list page I positioned the search bar at the top of the page, this lets the user search for more specific blogs based on a location or username. The searchbar will always be visible when scrolling up or down. The blogs list page just displays a list of random blogs (most recent posts). After the search bar a heading of "Blogs List" is displayed to indicate the list of blogs below. The blogs are displayed as cards with an image as well as minimal information like username, title of blog, location / country. The information is overlapping with the image as I wanted to save some space on the page. A gray background is overlayed on top of the image for better visiblity of the text. Based on the layout of the cards, we can use the React-Bootstrap library to create the layout (cards component and grid system). A navigation bar is displayed at the bottom of the page and will always be visible so users can easily navigate to other pages. 

![screenshot of mobile blogs list page wireframe](./docs/wireframe-images/mobile-blogs-list.png)  


### Mobile Blog Page and (Edit view)  

* The layout of the blog page is similar to the blog list page in that the search bar is at the top and the heading is below that, and the navigation bar is at the bottom of the page. Details of the blog like username, title of blog, description, etc. are displayed near the top of the page to show the user more detailed information about the blog. As this is a travel blogging application, we wanted to make sure that the pictures took up a large portion of the screen, this improves the aesthetics of the application and user experience. Below the pictures are a couple of buttons and icons that allow the user edit the blog if the user created the blog. These functions include editing the pictures, liking the blog (any user can like a blog), edit post button (allows the user to edit details of the blog), and delete post button. Next is a comments section, where the user can view comments and add comments to the blog. The last section displays the location of the blog on google maps (using google maps API).  
* The edit view of the blog page was initially created with all input boxes for all the data fields like title of post, location, and description. However, this was changed to have a edit post button to edit the details of the post, as there were multiple data points for location details (i.e. city, country, name of location, etc.) to edit. Once, the user clicks on the edit post button the user is redirected to an update post page to edit the details. 

![screenshot of mobile blog page and edit view wireframe](./docs/wireframe-images/mobile-blogpages.png)  


### Mobile Location and Username Blog Pages  

* These two pages have the same layout as the blog list page. They are the pages that will be rendered when a user searches for blogs in a specific location or username.

![screenshot of mobile location and username blog pages wireframe](./docs/wireframe-images/mobile-location-username.png)  



### Mobile User Profile and Edit view Pages  

* This is the user profile page, I placed the profile image at the top of the page followed by username as a heading to indicate to the user that they are in their profile page. Below that will be a section containing all the information stored for the user. In the edit view mode a form will appear to allow changes to be made to the profile. All elements in the form will be evenly spaced.

![screenshot of mobile user profile and edit view pages wireframe](./docs/wireframe-images/mobile-userprofile.png)  


### Mobile User Dashboard Page  

* The layout of the dashboard in similar to the blog list page, but there are different sections on the dashboard. Depending on the user's preferences in their profile (i.e. locaitons of interest, followed users), blogs will be listed in each section respectively. I placed arrow buttons on the side of the blog cards so that users can load the next set of blogs related to that section.


![screenshot of mobile user dashboard page wireframe](./docs/wireframe-images/mobile-dashboard.png)  


### Mobile Create and Edit Post Pages

* The create and edit post pages are essentially the same. They both have simple form layout.


![screenshot of mobile create and edit post pages wireframes](./docs/wireframe-images/mobile-create-edit-post.png)  


### Tablet Application Pages  

Link to Travelling Diary wireframe in Figma: [Travelling Diary wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/2SzEZyh3gIW4xpwTy1KAYM/Traveling-Diary?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=jx4ebmZ2z4hPXJbJ-0).  

* All of the tablet pages are essentially the same as the mobile view pages, except the top of the pages are slightly different in that there is the name of the applcation at the top of the pages as well as the navigation bar. Also, the blogs list and dashboard pages contain an extra set of blogs to fill up the space of the wider screen size. We tried to keep the layout similar to the mobile view as this would make it easier to create a responsive website with the use of certain components in React-Bootstrap library, like cards and grid system.

* The destop pages are very similar to the tablet pages, except the navigation bar is set at the top of the page, along with the name of the application and search bar. The nav bar and search bar will always be visible when scrolling down the page to allow the user to easily access other features of the application. The blog page layout is slightly different to the tablet and mobile views, in that the details of the blog and pictures are placed beside one another due to the wider screen size. Reponsiveness was taken into account when designing the layout of the application to allow ease of coding

#### Explanation of Packages and their uses for both the Frontend and Backend 

##### Front-end

@testing-library/jest-dom (^5.17.0):
This helps make it easier to test how your website looks and behaves by providing special tools for checking things like whether a certain element is visible or if a button is disabled.

@testing-library/react (^13.4.0):
This is a testing toolkit specifically made for React. It helps you test your React components in a way that's similar to how a user would interact with them.

@testing-library/user-event (^13.5.0):
This works alongside the previous package. It helps you simulate what a user might do, like typing in a form or clicking a button, to see if your components respond correctly.

bootstrap (^5.3.2):
This is a set of pre-made styles and components to make your website look good without having to design everything from scratch. It's like a shortcut for making your site visually appealing.

dotenv (^16.3.1):
This allows you to keep secret information, like passwords or API keys, separate from your code. It's like a safe place to store important but private details.
react (^18.2.0):
This is the main library you use to build your web application. It helps you create different parts of your website that can update and change without refreshing the whole page.

react-bootstrap (^2.9.1):
This is a special set of tools that helps you use Bootstrap with React. It's like a bridge between the cool styles and features of Bootstrap and the functional components you build with React.

react-dom (^18.2.0):
This helps React talk to the actual webpage. It's like the messenger between your React components and the browser.

react-router-dom (^6.20.1):
This is like a map for your website. It helps your React app figure out which "page" to show based on the web address. It's essential for creating multi-page applications.

react-scripts (5.0.1):
This is a bunch of tools and instructions that make it easy to start a new React project. It's like a helper that sets up everything you need to get going without having to worry about the details.

web-vitals (^2.1.4):
This helps you measure how well your website is performing for users. It's like a health checkup for your site to ensure it's running smoothly.

jest-fetch-mock (^3.0.3):
This is a helper for testing. It lets you pretend to make requests to the internet without actually doing it, so you can test how your app responds to data coming in. It's like a pretend internet for testing.

##### Back-end

@aws-sdk/client-s3": "^3.476.0"
This package is a part of the AWS SDK for Javascript and gives us the capability to interact with the Amazon S3 service. It allows us to utlise features such as creating/deleting buckets, uploading/downloading files from those buckets and setting policies/permissions on them.

@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner": "^3.476.0"
This package is also a part of the AWS SDK for Javascript and it gives us the capability to generate pre-signed URLS to allow temporary access to Amazon S3 resources without requiring AWS S3 credentials. It allows our users to gain temporary access to the S3 bucket to download or upload files through the web application. 

bcrypt": "^5.1.1"
This package is used for password hashing and is commonly used in web applications for securely storing user passwords. It allows us to hash passwords using a "salt" and a configurable number rounds of hashing. This makes reversing the process difficult and improves security as opposed to storing passwords as plain text. 

bcryptjs": "^2.4.3"
This package is an alternative to "bcrypt" and provides similar functionality for password hashing

cors": "^2.8.5"
This package is used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in an Express.js application. CORS is a mechanism that allows resources (e.g., fonts, JavaScript, etc.) on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated. t helps in preventing cross-origin security issues by specifying which origins are allowed to access the resources.

dotenv": "^16.3.1"
This package allows us to load environment variables from a .env file into Node.js applications. It allows us to utilise Environment variables that are useful for storing sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials) outside of the codebase. 

express": "^4.18.2"
Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It provides a set of features and utilities for building web applications and APIs. Express simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests, routing, middleware, and more.

jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.2"
This package is used for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in Node.js applications. JWTs are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties. They are commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes.

mongoose": "^8.0.3"
Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides us a straightforward way to interact with MongoDB databases by defining schemas and models. this package simplifies tasks like data validation, querying, and managing relationships between data.

multer": "^1.4.5-lts.1"
Multer is a middleware for handling multipart/form-data in Node.js. Multer can parse and store uploaded files, making it easy to process and save them to a storage system.

sharp": "^0.33.1"
Sharp is a high-performance image processing library for Node.js. It provides a simple and efficient API for resizing, cropping, and manipulating images. Sharp is often used in web applications for generating thumbnails, optimizing images, and performing other image-related tasks.

#### Summary of reasoning to cut some planned features 

- Dashboard
- Google API implementation into Frontend
- Comments and Likes 

We experienced some set backs to the project through unexpected complications with implementing features for the backend mainly Amazon S3. This put a set back to our work allocation which caused us to not have enough time to implement Google Maps API into the Frontend. We felt it would've caused further set backs to try implement it and make sure it runs correctly. 

Due to the set backs above we had to cut the User Dashboard and comments/likes feature. The two features were meant to come together to give the user much more responsiveness and feedback from the application. We had developed majority of the code and routes to have it ready for implementation but after some testing, we decided the feature wouldn't have added to the User experience and more likely cause errors to occurr ungracefully leaving a bad experience for the user. 

When Part B of the assignment was released, we discussed which part of the code we wanted to work on (frontend or backend). Francis decided to go with frontend, as he was more familiar with React, and Patrick was more comfortable with Node.js. We would also help each other out, if we ran into problems.
 We continued to use trello to plan and manage our tasks. Every week we would update the trello board and plan out our tasks for the week and check the overall progress of the project. We would have meetings three times per week on discord to discuss the progress and difficulties of the application which helped keep us on track. We included a testing column and a cancelled column in the trello board for Part B.

 This was a critical learning experience for us as developers to understand what errors we made in under estimating the effects of technical difficulties with certain aspects of the project. This experiene will allow us to plan projects much more effectively and improve communication as a team much more efficently.
